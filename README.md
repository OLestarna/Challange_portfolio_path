# Task 1 Software configuration
### Subtask 1: Why did I choose to participate in the challange portfolio?
Hello, my name is _Olena_! I decided to participate in this project to learn something new, to increase the quality and quantity of my portfolio, to have a better chance to find a job and build a successful career. My goal is to do as many assignments as possible to be able to win an internship at one of the project's partner companies.
